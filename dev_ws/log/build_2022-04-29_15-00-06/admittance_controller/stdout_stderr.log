CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findexternal_torque_sensor_broadcaster.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "external_torque_sensor_broadcaster", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "external_torque_sensor_broadcaster" with any of the following names:

    external_torque_sensor_broadcasterConfig.cmake
    external_torque_sensor_broadcaster-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "external_torque_sensor_broadcaster" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "external_torque_sensor_broadcaster_DIR" to a
  directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "external_torque_sensor_broadcaster" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
